# Pictures (`digitize.js` in `worker.js`)

Reference for this part of Needleworks: the rules, the reason for each (it stops someone undoing it) and the number that proved it. Hard rules are in `CLAUDE.md`. Add a lesson where its topic is, never as a round log.

- One job at a time, newest kept; restarted after 60 s. Styles: Filled (`build`), Line drawing (`lineArt`),
  Cross-stitch (`crossStitch`). No fabric selector: density is the only fabric knob.
- Colours are learned once per picture (`learnColours`, `LEARN` 800 px copy of the content box) and labelled onto any
  working image (`labelWith`): Size and Turn never change threads (`analyze` = both, for the batch).
- Palette: `FINE` 24 k-means clusters on flat pixels, background shades set aside, merged pairwise, cheapest first, to
  the count asked and on while under `SAME` 7 (CIEDE2000, hue weighted, darks below L 30 read black, non-solid groups
  cheap, cross-family dear). Each count = the next with one split (more colours never lose one). Default 6
  (`DEFAULTS`). Worse: kL 2 (stems into leaves), 16 clusters, folding slivers into neighbours. `findFrame`: an edge band
  of one colour family is a frame; learned again without it.
- Threads: each group the nearest unique Brother thread no bigger group took (CIEDE2000, never 62-64; plain Lab sent
  olive to Russet Brown); greys and other hue families (`FAMILY`, where Brother's names change) cost more for hued
  colours; the background's thread is skipped unless within SAME. Swatch = solid pixels' mean. The writer's red-mean
  then picks the same thread. Owned threads only: `toPalette()` merges colours landing on one spool.
- Colours from thin lines: `cluster(..., lines)` also learns from pixels flat along a line and not a blend (a 1-2 px
  line is never flat every way); those clusters take only pixels within ΔE 12 or not a blend of two others. Pale
  fringes (JPEG halos: 80 % within 3 px of a stronger colour over 1.5 SAME away) and soft shades (drop shadows: 70 % of
  the edge with the fabric soft over 5 px) are fabric unless the whole picture is soft. Colours under SAME apart
  merge whatever their size. Worse: half-soft colours to fabric when threads run short, scattered pale specks as
  fabric (both erased etsy_1's pale flowers).
- Size = the sewn design's longer side (`picturePlan`, capped to the field), rebuilt when over 0.4 mm off; over the
  field it shrinks, not errors. 8 px/mm (5 lost notches).
- `sewSized` (app.js and picture_corpus): tries from fit 1 every time, cached per exact setting (`picFits`); carrying
  the last fit made results depend on history. Cross-stitch may miss the Size (closest try wins, over counts 1.5x).
- Left out: `keptParts(pictureInk(...))` on the learned copy; `lostMuch` (5 % of area, or 3+ parts and 20 %, or one
  part of 1.4 mm2+ on a picture of 20 parts or fewer) is the `lost` problem with fixes checked on a second worker
  (`picChecks`; kept = 3 of 4 lost parts). The thin-line note is `hairline`, not said with it.
- `findFrame`: a frame covers at least half of two sides meeting at a corner (a ground line was dropped as a frame);
  "Sew the edge band too" (`opts.edge`). Lost parts are ringed on the thumbnail (`markThumb`); `#pic-size-note`
  explains a size gap. Filled keeps "eyes" (a dot of 0.6 mm2+ inside another colour, up to 6 per colour). Line drawing:
  outline bands sewn once from `tO >= 0.5 tS`; `oneInk`: no join across bare fabric between different colours.
- Filled: shapes 1 mm or wider get tatami following the outline (skeleton satin broke corners); parts under 2 x
  `THIN_PART` and lines under 1 mm sew a triple run, never dropped. Specks: under 4 mm² and 2.5 mm across, groups
  under 6 mm of line, walks under 1.5 mm (`lostLines` reports dropped fine lines). Kept: text dots on the fabric (>= 0.8 mm across, 0.6
  mm², within 5 mm of their colour or another such dot) and marks >= 2 mm long, 1.5x longer than wide, within 2 mm of a
  bigger piece of their colour (apostrophes). Thin shapes (< 2 mm) 0.05 mm
  pull, else 0.15. `OVERLAP` 0.35 mm under later colours, shape by shape (growing the raw mask merged specks);
  neighbours alternate angle (+90°). `DENSITY` Standard 0.4 (the app's default; `DEFAULTS.density` is Dense) / Dense
  0.35; 0.3 fails the check (row links under 0.3 mm). Row steps split to 3 mm, row-end stitches over 4 mm halved.
- Travel (`makeRouter`, A* on 0.5 mm cells; Ink/Stitch's tatami travel): `routeFill` takes sections in row order
  through rows not sewn yet (`reach`), at most `SEWN` 3 mm on finished rows, repeated travel costs more, `WORN` 20
  crossings closes a cell. Between shapes (up to `TRAVEL` 10 mm) travel hides under fill still to come; moves under
  2 mm are sewn; else a jump over 5 mm (trimmed) beats 2-5 mm (loose). Budgets in cells (`routeBudget`), not time, so
  browser and Node match.
- Line drawing (`opts.line`, Auto = darkest): outlines once where colours meet, none between colours within ΔE00 15;
  dark bands (`BAND`) and whole even strokes sewn once along their centre (both edges drew double lines), decided once
  per colour (centre lines if 80 % of its long pieces are strokes; fat letters outlined; marker lines up to 6 mm;
  spurs pruned at 0.6 width; narrow elongated parts of any colour centre-lined); text dots a short out-and-back line;
  `closeSlivers`; `lineEnds` reach the ink's edge; pieces under 2 mm dropped (`spur: 1`: pruning cut letters apart);
  ends within 2 mm of another drawing joined (3 mm drew bars). JPEG ringing is fabric: thin pieces under 5 mm of a colour
  at least 30 ΔE00 from the fabric whose own pixels are under 30 % of that (40 % with no floor cut etsy_1's lavender).
- Cross-stitch (`cross` mm cells): a row is two diagonal zigzags out and back plus one straight stitch (climbing every
  edge drew bowties); runs chained by Dijkstra over cell corners, else a jump over 5 mm; a lone cell dropped only if
  nothing touches it.
- `fine` (`narrowGaps`: gaps under 0.5 mm, at least 2 mm² and 1.5 % of the area) warns; notches under ~0.5 mm can't
  be kept by thread. Errors carry `code` (small, cross, skipped, empty); only followable advice is offered.
